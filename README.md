Used the MVC Design Pattern for this project.

Therefore I divided this app in 3 sections: Model, View and Controller:
-The Model is responsible for managing the applicationâ€™s data, business logic, and rules. It represents the core functionality of the application.
-The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user. It is the user interface of the application.
-The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It processes user input and determines how the application should respond.
